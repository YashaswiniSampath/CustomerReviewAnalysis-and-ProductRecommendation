# Customer Review Analysis and Product Recommendation Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to uncover insights and recommend products based on user preferences. Using NLP, sentiment analysis, clustering, and KNN, it identifies trends in customer feedback, groups similar products, and suggests items users might like. The system combines collaborative and content-based filtering to make recommendations more personalized.


## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

1. **Review Mining and Sentiment Analysis:** Extract customer reviews and perform sentiment analysis to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **NLP with SpaCy and Hugging Face Transformers:** Leverage SpaCy and Hugging Face Transformers for text analysis and processing tasks.

3. **Statistical Approaches and LDA:** Implement statistical methods and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for uncovering latent topics within the review corpus.

4. **3-Layer Matrix Approach:** Hierarchical approach to user-product relationships, considering categories, sub-categories, and unique items.

5. **KNN and Clustering:** Utilize KNN with cosine similarity and clustering algorithms to find user-product relationships.

6. **Handling Large Customer Base:** Use of clusters to represent similar customers, reducing time complexity.

7. **Handling Large Product Catalog:** Categorize products into limited categories and sub-categories.

8. **Handling New Customer Data:** Provide recommendations using best-seller products and user interactions like searches and views.
